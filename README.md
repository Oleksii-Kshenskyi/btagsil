# A BTAGSIL prototype on Python

This is one of the experimental [Language Feast](https://github.com/Oleksii-Kshenskyi/btagsil/milestone/3) branches where I write the same prototype in several different languages to assess which language/technology is best suited for a text adveneture game.

## Licensing

The licensing on every single prototype of the Language Feast milestone is [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/). You can do whatever you want with them. The main game is most likely going to remain licensed under MIT.
